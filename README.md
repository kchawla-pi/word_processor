A simple utility I wrote for someone on reddit to read a text file and extract all the unique words from it.  
It filters out words with contractions but does not handle stem words yet.

I might develop it into a more sophisticated word extraction program in the future with more libraries etc.

Instructions are not comprehensive, assume you know how to run python programs from the terminal.
Usage:    
Run the file `words_from_textfile.py` using python3 and enter the path to the text file.  
The output file will be generated in the same directory/folder.
